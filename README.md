# Count Xeno the 4th

Proof of concept for ethberlin. Verifies an APK proof from a foreign curve (Ethereum EVM only has BN254 precompile) in solidity.

## Motivation

For BLS signatures, the EVM currently only has a precompile for BN-254 integrated. However, many other curves are of interest, including for security and performance reasons. This project solves verifying an aggregate BLS signature on Ethereum, where Ethereum doesnâ€™t natively support the curved used via a precompile, such as BLS12 381 and 377. The signature scheme is accountable, and the applications are lit: having an accountable signature scheme permits use cases such as transparent DAOs (with efficient signature aggregation) and trustless bridges (since misbehavers can be slashed).

## Development

### Install dependencies

We require `rust`, [`anvil`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) and `solc-select` to be installed in order to run the test.

In order to update the json file with ABI and bytecode in case of solidity file changes, you would need `solc` version 0.7.6:

``` bash
solc-select install 0.7.6
solc-select use 0.7.6
solc apk_verifier.sol --combined-json=abi,bin > apk_verifier.json
# update the json file bytecode and abi sections
solc src/apk_verifier.sol --combined-json=abi,bin --optimize | jq '.contracts."src/apk_verifier.sol:ApkVerifier"' | sed 's/\\"/"/g' > src/verifier_artifact.json
# NOTE: you might need to edit the json file to remove the extra quotes
# around abi array
```

### Run tests

To run it, first navigate the rust crate folder and then:

```bash
cargo test


To run, call

``` sh
cd count-xeno-the-4th
cargo test solidity_verifier
